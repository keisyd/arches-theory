# Arches Analysis

This is a book about how to understand **power**, **money**, **positioning**, planning and progress from an individual perspective. Often times we feel trapped or stuck on our lives not knowing what to do next. Sometimes because we know nothing about where we want to get, sometimes because we can’t quite figure out what the next best step is. So, this book offers a mental model and a series of tools to figure those things out and go further beyond, say, making achievements possible.

 It is a compendium that segments this problem into various models* that work together to form a grounded understanding of the interactions that generates one given **state of the Market**. As a bonus, this books suggests how to use those models to understand your position on your current market and how to analyze the position of the most relevant close (intractable) players in order to build an intentional arch for yourself. In other words, it server as a guideline for you to understand and design the path for you to build your wealth in a unlimited scale ( it’s more complicated than that, but it can be unlimited ).

This whole analysis is personal, meaning it’s focused on an individual. It seeks for simplicity and applicability and it doesn’t aim to be a final truth. So, as much as anything in science evolve, so may those concepts that will follow and also the techniques.

Overall, this is the Arches theory that are so called because it intends to be a model for understanding any given result or position on the market as the sum of those arches that produced this result and, because human nature is the same, it gives the power of predictability, meaning that it’s possible to determine an arbitrary position ( such as being a billionaire in the stock market ) and then calculate what actions should be taken today to get there and also estimate how long would it take to do so for each path generate from the calculated arches .

# Power and Money

The first big concepts that have to be understood in order to follow along are Power and Money. Because, there's often a misunderstanding about the position of money on the actual effects that are seen around the market. Because what we see are effects on the lens of this theory, let's start here.

## Effects

Effects are what moves us. Ignorance would place us in a state of unwillingness to change if there weren't for those expeptional dreaming individuals. Most of us want stuff, status, money, wealthy, but just because we see others having it. All of that, we're a going to call effects. But what it means is that they are effects of the arches, not of the individuals willingness to achieve some state.
A lot like a surf, this theory presumes that, like the waves, the arches move to the effects if you are in the right position.

Sure, you have to be able to handle the force, the balance and much to have the possibility to enjoy the arche and percieve the actual effects. It's often seen those celebrities that achieve much nice effects, but they couldn't handle the punch of "How" they got there, so some broke down, some got sick, and so on. Not all surfists get safe to the end of the wave, sure, but it was the wave that made any nice trick possible.

This comparison between a Market player and a surfist is not new, so the effects getting caused by waves and positioning isn't either. The thing that differ here, is that, in the Arches Theory, you can choose some waves to create your own arche.
